                         <h3>location</h3>
                         <p>(Arabic:Al-Mamlakah Al-Urdunnīyah Al-Hāshimīyah), is a sovereign Arab state in Western Asia,
                         on the East Bank of the Jordan River. Jordan is bordered by Saudi Arabia to the south, Iraq to the north-east,
                         Syria to the north, Israel and Palestine to the west.
                         The Dead Sea lies along its western borders
                         and the country has a small shoreline on the Red Sea in its extreme south-west,
                         but is otherwise landlocked.[7] Jordan is strategically located
                         at the crossroads of Asia, Africa and Europe.[8] The capital,
                         Amman, is Jordan's most populous city as well as the country's 
                         economic, political and cultural centre.[9]</p>

                              <h1>History</h1>
                              <h3>Ancient period</h3>
                              <p>The oldest evidence of hominid habitation in Jordan dates back at least 200,000 years.
                                [21] Jordan is rich in Paleolithic (up to 20,000 years ago) 
                                remains due to its location within the Levant where expansions of hominids out of Africa converged.
                                [22] Past lakeshore environments attracted different hominids, and several remains of tools have been found from this period.
                                [22] The world's oldest evidence of bread-making was found in a 14,500 years old Natufian site in Jordan's northeastern desert.
                                [23] The transition from hunter-gatherer to establishing populous agricultural villages occurred during the Neolithic period 
                                (10,000–4,500 BC).[24] 'Ain Ghazal, one such village located in today's eastern Amman, is one of the largest known prehistoric
                                 settlements in the Near East.[25] Dozens of plaster statues of the human form dating to 7250 BC were uncovered there and they
                                  are among the oldest ever found.
                                  [26] Other than the usual Chalcolithic (4500–3600 BC) villages such as Tulaylet Ghassul in the Jordan Valley,
                                  [27] a series of circular stone enclosures in the eastern basalt desert−whose purpose remains uncertain–have 
                                  baffled archaeologists.[28]
 
 
                                 The Mesha Stele (c. 840 BC) recorded the glory of Mesha, the King of Moab.
                                 Fortified towns and urban centers first emerged in the southern Levant early on in the Bronze Age (3600–1200 BC).
                                 [29] Wadi Feynan became a regional center for copper extraction, which was exploited on a large-scale to produce bronze.
                                 [30] Trade and movement of people in the Middle East peaked, spreading and refining civilizations.
                                 [31] Villages in Transjordan expanded rapidly in areas with reliable water resources and agricultural land.
                                 [31] Ancient Egyptians expanded towards the Levant and controlled both banks of the Jordan River.
                                 [32] During the Iron Age (1200–332 BC) after the withdrawal of the Egyptians,
                                  Transjordan was home to Ammon, Edom and Moab.[33] They spoke Semitic languages of the Canaanite group,
                                   and are considered to be tribal kingdoms rather than states.[33] Ammon was located in the Amman plateau;
                                    Moab in the highlands east of the Dead Sea; and Edom in the area around Wadi Araba down south.[33]</p>
